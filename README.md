## Using this Schema
### As a content creator
You've spent time building the perfect adventure or a new set of monsters for the game, but why not make it easily consumable by tools and applications that DM's use at the table.  By creating a representation of your content in JSON, you can expose it in a way a book or PDF never could!
### As a developer
No more trying to import or work with unstructured 5e data that changes from implementation to implementation.  A standard makes it easy to build against and verify content that your app consumes providing a better experience for both yourselves and your users.  Use as much or as little as needed to build the app you've always wanted to have around the gaming table.
