## A 5e JSON Schema
The amount of content being created by Wizards of the Coast and indie developers is increasing on a daily basis, but all of the apps and tools that DMs and players can use aren't able to keep up.  The 5e schema is designed around providing a structured format that content creators can use to provide their content to app developers to consume.

For example, a representation of the data for the 5e SRD from Wizards of the Coast can be found [here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swimminschrage/5e-schema/master/modules/srd.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Swimminschrage/5e-schema/master/modules/srd.json)

With a common schema, tools can be created that not only consume this data, but make it easy to create and host it for players and DMs alike.

### What is JSON
JSON stands for *J*ava*S*cript *O*bject *N*otation. It's designed to be a lightweight format for storing and transmitting data.  It's designed to easily allow 

## Loading Modules
Loading custom content into an application will vary by application, but can usually be done via url, upload, or even QR code that points the application to the content's JSON representation.  Once loaded, apps can make use of all of the following data defined within their files:

* Custom Spells
* Creature Stat Blocks
* Chapters of Modules
* Predefined Encounters
* and more!

## Creating Modules
You've spent time building the perfect adventure or a new set of monsters for the game, but why not make it easily consumable by tools and applications that DM's use at the table. By creating a representation of your content in JSON, you can expose it in a way a book or PDF never could and help it stand out to your customers.
